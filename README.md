# **Background**
**Start Mart(Fictional supermarket)** is a well-known supermarket chain that provides various products, ranging from fruits, meats, fish, sweets, wines, and gold. To make it easier for their customers, they offer channels for shopping through offline stores, web stores, and catalog stores.

Start Mart also has a membership program that offers many benefits for customers in the form of points and discounts. Through this program, they can also collect information about the customer.

Over the past two years, Start Mart has held various promotional campaigns to attract customer interest and boost their sales. However, Start Mart has realized that the sales levels did not reach their target expectations.

Based on the customer membership data recorded for the past two years, Star Mart wants to further analyze their Customer Segmentation and formulate a strategy for their next campaign, determining which channel of purchase they should prioritize.

The acceptance rate of the top demographic is very low


The most prefered channel of purchase is through stores and seconded by web.

# **Recommendation**
Based on the analysis conducted, we recommend targeting the Generation X demographic with a Graduation education level, specifically focusing on couples within the Lower Middle Class income group who are also parents.

For the upcoming campaign, the primary channel should be in-store, with the web serving as a secondary channel.
